## Problem

Given two integers, $X$ and $Y$, find their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

**Input Format**

 Two lines containing one integer each ($X$ and $Y$, respectively).  


**Constraints**

$-100 \le X,Y \le 100$  
$Y \ne 0$


**Output Format**

 Four lines containing the sum ($X+Y$), difference ($X-Y$), product ($X \times Y$), and quotient ($X \div Y$), respectively.  
(While computing the quotient, print only the integer part.)
